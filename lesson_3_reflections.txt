When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repositiory is better if you want to work on your files from different computers,
e.g. a desktop computer at home and a notebook if you are travelling. It is also better if
you want to collaborate with others on the files, so everybody has access to the repository.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If others are working on the repository and push changes to the files, an
automatic pull could mess up my files. There might be situations where I have
to merge changes manually, and I want to do it exactly when I want to.



Describe the difference between forks, clones and branches. When would
you use one instead of the other?

A fork is used to copy a repository on GitHub. A clone is used to copy
a repository from GitHub to my local computer or to clone a local
repository. Branches are part of repositories.
