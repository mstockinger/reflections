What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates its infrastructure, i.e. creates the .git folder and all relevant
files and subfolders that are needed to use Git. Only if this infrastructure is
present, you can commit files to the repository and use Git to track changes.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

You can add files on at a time and then do a single commit. You can keep track
of all the files you changed if you add them to the staging area immediately
after a change.



How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

Change all the relevant files related to the logical change and add them to the
staging area, then commit. If you have files changed which are not related to
the logical change, leave them out.



What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

If you want to explore alternative concepts or make substantial changes. You can
create a branch for it and work on these changes without influencing the main
branch.
